# Crypto Chart App (minimal)

This is a minimal Flutter example app that fetches Bitcoin price history from CoinGecko and displays a 7-day chart using `fl_chart`.

Quick start:

1. Install Flutter SDK and ensure `flutter` is on your PATH.
2. From the project root run:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Notes:
- This is a starter template — extend with state management, caching, multiple coins, and background updates.
- CoinGecko is used without an API key; be mindful of rate limits.
